# Django REST API - Testing Study Project
## Overview

This repository is a study project aimed at exploring different ways to test 
a Django REST API. The project showcases how to build a basic API using Django 
and Django REST Framework (DRF), with a strong focus on implementing and 
comparing various testing techniques and tools.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate best practices for testing 
Django applications, with a particular focus on pytest library, integration 
tests, and testing REST APIs.

## Features
